Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the day Siuan was deposed: [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time she was Raised."

At the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul. This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends. This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), the [Dragon](#The-Dragon), and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting _saidin_ itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: 1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim) on a small farm in Saldaea (still intact). Despite being made of _cuendillar_, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.

Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the War of the Shadow. He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin—he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.

He and his half-brother [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) went to train with the Warders in the White Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess considerable skill with the sword. During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support—he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader. He believes the rumor that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. His sign is a white boar."

In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah, although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself. However, both of the current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they serve, although for vastly different reasons—Alviarin is essentially trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black sister raised in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to overstep [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) because she has a hard time thinking of Egwene being anything more than the frightened novice that came to her study not so long ago."

Her final discovery there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed by men and women alike—this source turned out to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s prison. She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him. Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married Ilyena Moerelle, she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her. She declared as her territory the World of Dreams, _Tel'aran'rhiod_, using it to ends now unknown. She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), after being freed from the Bore.

Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father [Abell](#Abell-Cauthon) is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons), who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general—this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat is currently in Ebou Dar trying to keep an eye on [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) and [Nynaeve](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) from getting themselves killed."

She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by [Liandrin](#Liandrin) on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) the moment of Moiraine's death."

Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan."

Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.

He was raised by Tam al'Thor and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish Laman's Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually Tigraine Mantear, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting [Ishamael](#Ishamael). He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the _[Car'a'carn](#Car-a-carn)_, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the [Coramoor](#Coramoor), the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.

His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering “under the forgotten symbol,” that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the “spotless tower” break and bend knee to him (several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).

After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat). She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to date. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne)—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army. She had a Warder named [Alric](#Alric), but he died when she was deposed. After coming to Salidar, [Nynaeve](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She can now lie as well as any child. She now serves as an “advisor” to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), but though she puts on a façade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's foremost agents.

He was at Dragonmount as part of the Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young. He became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster status, acquiring a heron-mark sword. He married a woman from Caemlyn, Kari, who he met while stationed there. When the Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain. Tam and Kari raised Rand as their own son. Tam always won the archery competitions (or came in second to [Abell Cauthon](#Abell-Cauthon)), and passed his archery skills on to Rand. He also taught [Aram](#Aram) how to use his sword. Tam had no idea that the child he was raising was the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn)."

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but don't grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for her."
