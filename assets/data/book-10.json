Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since [Bonwhin](#Bonwhin-Meraighdin), who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The Amyrlin Seat was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed: [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised."

She has green eyes, and is of age with [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). She is more than pretty with her dark reddish hair. Aviendha is one of the three women in [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s viewing of Rand—she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as “wetlanders” did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other's arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt _toh_ toward [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a _second_ sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least. She has been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves—a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters. Aviendha has a special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so without her knowing it immediately."

She was succeeded by Deane Aryman of the Blue Ajah, who took office after years of disorder in the Tower where no Amyrlin was chosen and attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower's reputation. Deane succeeded for the most part.

This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), the [Dragon](#The-Dragon), and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting _saidin_ itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World.

He became one of the Light's greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin. Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the War of the Shadow. He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin—he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed. When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor). Demandred was recently told by the [Dark One](#Dark-One) to lead his plan to convert or destroy Rand, and promised him to be Nae'blis if he succeeded. However, since [Moridin](#Moridin) has been declared Nae'blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin. Demandred's assumed identity and whereabouts are unknown."

She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Egwene is good friends with [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne's brothers, [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) and [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand)—she is flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene has enlisted [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne) as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove Elaida from power. She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history—in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. This policy has increased the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original, unified one. The number of novices has increased to levels not known for over a thousand years. Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of _cuendillar_. She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of _cuendillar_ by [Moghedien](#Moghedien) while she was captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone. She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well. She plans to reunite the Tower and make it stronger than ever—and she plans to start by exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into fragments that will never be gathered up again."

    "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to [Queen Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) of Andor for her entire reign. She later led the coup that deposed [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the Blue Ajah again. Her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) is [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) of the White Ajah—she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then _she_ would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another of her Foretellings was to predict that [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that “the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.” The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred), and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), Taringail, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was stilled and Healed), [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually _did_ shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower. She has no plans on being merciful on those who rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan—her terms are that the Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the Tower."

Elayne later went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a _ter'angreal_ that they used to fix the weather. She has since returned to Andor upon hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it. In the meantime, Elayne has managed to reproduce several _ter'angreal_, something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel tradition, and Min."

Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), especially the one she saw that included herself: he was destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which was herself. She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire. Min was in Tar Valon helping [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) with her viewings' information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from the dungeon.

During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support—he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader.

During the coup led by [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) and [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and stilled.

She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper. She was later Healed by [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and restored to some of her former capacity for using the One Power. The Hall of the Tower in Salidar decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and void. Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first sister to ever switch Ajahs. Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself. These spies are very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar Valon, but also what the Ajahs are leaving out of their reports to [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere).

This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the present-day city of Tar Valon.

He moved to his private estates in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), the former [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat); [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), the former [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), and [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw). When these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer curiosity to Salidar. Once there, he discovered the true identity of the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken. The Aes Sedai in Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the Amyrlin Seat from [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), since he was the only commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help them. He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel Waste, in a league with [Pedron Niall](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Pedron-Niall), [Rodel Ituralde](#Lord-Rodel-Ituralde), [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), [Agelmar Jagad](#Lord-Agelmar-Jagad), and [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). Although neither of them would admit it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to avoid another mistake like his relationship as [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand)'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for when she publicly shamed him years ago. She seems to be developing similar feelings for him, much to her dismay. He planned to be the first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever came was with Guaire Amalasan's armies, who got as far as the White Tower itself, and [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing), who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city. Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships coming up the river. Bryne thought he will be able to overcome this problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) brought the entire army to Tar Valon by Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he is pressuring her to let him use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city. He is stocky, with a bluff face. The years have given him some sort of comforting calmness. Men always follow him—they have learned from history that doing so is the path to military victory."

Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and [Bodewhin](#Bodewhin-Bode-Cauthon), who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she was not the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons), who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He created an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general—this worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there he was cornered by [Queen Tylin](#Tylin-Quintara-Mitsobar), who gave him little choice but to become her lover. When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so it looked “official”—Tylin was found torn limb from limb, obviously by the _gholam_ which was no doubt sent to kill Mat. In the process of leaving, Mat also took several _sul'dam_ and _damane_ (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even kidnapped [Tuon](#High-Lady-Tuon-Athaem-Kore-Paendrag), the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons) herself.

Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself. Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as _Tel'aran'rhiod_, the World of Dreams) with them. Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow _ta'veren_ [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of [Faile](#Faile-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara) (which means “Falcon” in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn. The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man—he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helps considerably when helping [Master Luhhan](#Haral-Luhhan) on his forge, but sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars. When he returned, he began to draw the eye of [Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron), the First of Mayene—Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy. Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame [Masema](#Masema-Dagar).

He was raised by Tam al'Thor and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish Laman's Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually [Tigraine Mantear](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting Ishamael. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the _Car'a'carn_, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the Coramoor, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) to kill Be'lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed Ishamael in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, Lanfear confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed [Rahvin](#Rahvin) in _Tel'aran'rhiod_ when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; Asmodean, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate; and [Osan'gar](#Osan-gar), the reincarnation of Aginor, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was cleansing _saidin_. His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering “under the forgotten symbol,” that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the “spotless tower” (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He recently used the Choedan Kal, the two great _sa'angreal_ created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint from _saidin_. He has created a school of sorts, more of a research university where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated at the Great Library of Cairhien to develop new technology. Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his “amnesty” for male channelers. With _saidin_ cleansed, the Asha'man are now safe from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint. However, Rand has not been seen since he cleansed _saidin_, which was certainly the single greatest event in the history of the world since the War of Power. Rand is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he _will_ save the world—and Break it again."

Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law. As a novice, she was good friends with [Moiraine Damodred](#Moiraine-Damodred), and was present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat). She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to that point. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne)—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army. She had a Warder named Alric, but he died when she was deposed. After coming to Salidar, [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She can now lie as well as any child. She now serves as an “advisor” to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), but though she puts on a façade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's foremost agents. The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to this fact. She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice."

Her Warder is named [Tomas](#Tomas). She is more interested in current events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened now, only what happened years ago. She gave Egwene the twisted stone ring _ter'angreal_ to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) that there was really no need to keep her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway. When Verin went to the Two Rivers with [Alanna](#Alanna-Mosvani), they helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon)'s sister [Bode](#Bodewhin-Bode-Cauthon). When she and Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town. Verin is quite old—her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means she is quite old indeed. She is now with [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin)'s group of sisters in Tear."

    "info": "The uncrowned king of Malkier, and former Warder to [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred). He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional—in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon), [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she accompanies. According to the Wise Ones, _Aan'allein_ (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not _the_ best, warriors (and Warders) in the World."

    "chapter": "Chapter 12: A Bargain",
    "info": "Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond's Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by Liandrin on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) at the moment of Moiraine's death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the _ki'sain_, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes—Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Because she was the only person Rand felt he could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to assist him when he cleansed _saidin_. She is now recovering from the exertion, as is Rand, in Tear."
