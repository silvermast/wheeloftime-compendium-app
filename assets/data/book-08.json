Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the day Siuan was deposed: [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time she was Raised."

She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as “wetlanders” did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other's arms before coming back.

She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when refusing even once is unheard of. She also refused to become head of the Green Ajah. It is said that she has had more Warders than most sisters have had shoes. She has more strength than anyone in a thousand years except [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand). Although a Green, she has confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman; unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being gentled than the average. She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai. According to [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), Cadsuane will teach [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and the Asha'man something—they will not like it, but they will have to learn it."

Another was to predict that [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that “the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.” The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), Galad, and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of Tigraine, Taringail, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan, [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and a few others can match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower."

Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), especially the one she saw that included herself: he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which is herself. She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire. Min was in Tar Valon helping [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) with her viewings' information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from the dungeon. She accompanied the two former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand. Once in Caemlyn, she brought information to Rand about the embassy there, and their intentions.

The city finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand, every rock, every sip of water with its hatred. Mordeth's soul remained in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (“Where the Shadow Waits”) for millenia—he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to the outside world.

She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like [Berelain](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron) who eye her husband all the time. She even cornered [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) when they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no intentions toward him."

Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Lord-Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the Daughter of the Nine Moons, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He currently leads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general—this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat is currently in Ebou Dar trying to keep an eye on [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and prevent them from getting themselves killed."

Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including [Thomdril Merrilin](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin), a former court-bard; [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne), her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently [Lord Gaebril](#Lord-Gaebril), a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) of the Red Ajah, who is now the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. When Morgase discovered that Gaebril meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: [Pedron Niall](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Pedron-Niall) and the Children of the Light. She is not aware that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) only wants to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she made her presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her own and trust no one.

He was raised by [Tam al'Thor](#Tamlin-Tam-al-Thor) and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish [Laman](#King-Laman-Damodred)'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually Tigraine Mantear, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting Ishamael. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the _[Car'a'carn](#Car-a-carn)_, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the [Coramoor](#Coramoor), the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Lord-Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed [Aginor](#Aginor) at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) to kill Be'lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed Ishamael in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, Lanfear confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed [Rahvin](#Rahvin) in _Tel'aran'rhiod_ when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and [Asmodean](#Asmodean), his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate. His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering \"under the forgotten symbol,\" that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the \"spotless tower\" break and bend knee to him (several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he _will_ save the world—and Break it again."

This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), the [Dragon](#The-Dragon), and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting _saidin_ itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: 1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim) on a small farm in Saldaea (still intact).

As a novice, she was good friends with [Moiraine Damodred](#Moiraine-Damodred), and was present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat). She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to date. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne)—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army. She had a Warder named Alric, but he died when she was deposed. After coming to Salidar, [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She can now lie as well as any child. She now serves as an “advisor” to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), but though she puts on a façade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's foremost agents.

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style).

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she leads."

She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by [Liandrin](#Liandrin) on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) at the moment of Moiraine's death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together."
